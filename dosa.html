			<h2>Ingredients Required:</h2>
			<p>

				<ul>
					
					<li>3/4 cup Parboiled Rice (idli-dosa rice)</li>
				<li>3/4 cup Regular Rice</li>	
				<li>1/2 cup Whole Urad Dal (without skin) or Split Urad Dal (black lentils)</li>	
				<li>1/4 teaspoon Fenugreek Seeds (methi dana)</li>	
				<li>1/2 tablespoon Chana Dal (gram lentils), optional</li>	
				<li>Water, as needed</li>	
				<li>Salt to taste</li>	
				<li>Oil, for shallow frying</li>	

				</ul>

			</p>

			<h2>Process:</h2>

			<p>
				Wash the rice and urad daal well. Add the fenugreek seeds to the mix and fill enough water in the rice-daal bowl to cover them about 2-inch deep. Soak overnight.The next morning, drain all the water from the rice and urad daal. Now put some in a food processor and grind—adding very little water if necessary—to a smooth yet slightly grainy paste.
			</p>

			<p>When all the rice-daal mix is ground like this, put it into a large mixing bowl and add enough water to make a batter. The consistency of the batter should be such that it thickly coats a spoon dipped in it.Now add salt to taste and keep the dosa batter aside in a warm, dark spot, covered, for 6 to 8 hours. After this fermentation, stir the batter well. It is now ready to make dosas.Put some cooking oil in a small bowl and keep ready. You will also need a bowl of ice cold water, a large, flat nonstick pan, 2 sheets of paper towel, a ladle, a spatula, and a basting brush.</p>

			<p>Fold one sheet of paper towel into a wad and dip lightly into the bowl of cooking oil. Squeeze out any excess and then rub the paper towel all over the surface of the pan to grease. The correct amount of oil is such that it is barely visible in the pan. Now turn on the heat/ flame at medium high.Fill the ladle up to the 3/4 level with dosa batter. Gently pour this batter onto the center of the pan—just as you would for a pancake—till the ladle is empty.Now begin to spread the batter in sweeping circular motions to form a pancake of roughly 8-inch diameter. Do not be alarmed if the dosa develops tiny holes as you spread the batter. This is normal.As soon as you have finished spreading the batter out on the pan, dip the basting brush in cooking oil and drizzle the oil all over the surface of the dosa and also around its edges. Now hold the pan by its handle, lift up and swirl it so as to make the drizzled oil spread all over the dosa.​
				</p>
				<p>
			When the upper surface begins to look cooked (it will no longer look soft or runny), flip the dosa. By this time, ideally, the surface that was underneath should be light golden in color. Cook for 1 minute after flipping.

			The dosa is almost done. Fold it in half and allow to cook for 30 seconds more.
